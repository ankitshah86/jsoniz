# Jsoniz

Jsoniz is an open-source database system, currently in its preliminary stages of development. Crafted with the efficiency and concurrency features of Golang, Jsoniz aims to deliver a robust solution that supports both NoSQL (JSON-based) and SQL paradigms, including JOIN operations and comprehensive ACID compliance.

## Project Goals

The key objectives of Jsoniz include:

- **Versatility**: Jsoniz aims to offer the flexibility of NoSQL data handling, coupled with the powerful querying capabilities of SQL.
- **Scalability**: Jsoniz is being designed with a focus on horizontal scalability to accommodate growth in data and user base.
- **ACID Compliance**: Guaranteeing transactional reliability and data integrity is a crucial goal for Jsoniz.
- **Efficiency**: Through efficient indexing, sharding, and replication strategies, Jsoniz intends to optimize data storage and retrieval operations.

## Roadmap

Jsoniz is currently in the initial planning and setup phase. Here's a broad roadmap for our journey ahead:

- Project Setup and Planning
- Designing the Core Database Architecture
- Implementing Basic SQL and NoSQL Operations
- Building Transaction and Recovery Managers
- Ensuring ACID Compliance
- Enhancing Data Storage and Retrieval Efficiency
- Implementing Scalability Measures
- Testing, Benchmarking, and Optimization

Please note that the roadmap is tentative and subject to changes and improvements as the project evolves.

## Contributing

While Jsoniz is still in its early stages, we're excited about contributions from the open-source community. Detailed guidelines on how you can contribute will be shared soon.

## License

Jsoniz is anticipated to be released under the MIT License. More details will be shared as the project progresses.

We're thrilled to have you on this journey with us. Stay tuned for more updates!
